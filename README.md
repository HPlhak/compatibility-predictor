# compatibility-predictor

DataHouse would like to add new members to its team. To help assess candidates, this program gives each applicant a compatibily score between 0 and 1 (0 indicating the lowest possible compatibility and 1 indicating the most). 

## Description

Given a list of current team members and their respective scores (1-10) for intelligence, strength, endurance, and spicy food tolerance, we would like to predict the compatibility of each applicant. Determining compabiltilty is open-ended, so I narrowed down the team's objective to this: search for applicants who would contribute something that the team currently lacks, with a focus on intelligence more than other attriubtes. When an applicant ranks higher than the team average for a given attribute, their overall compatibility score increases.
